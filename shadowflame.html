            Description
        </h3>

        <p>
            Shadowflame Elementals are humanoid creatures constantly covered in what we call "Shadow flames". They are
            constantly on fire, capable of burning even without any source of fuel or oxygen.
        </p>

        <p>Apart from eternally being on fire, most of them make themselves some sort of armor at a young age to
            differentiate each other. Each member of the species has a different eye color, and they mostly make armor
            matching said color. Each Shadowflame has a different colored eye, but on the off-chance that there are
            two extremely similar ones, they have a rule to wear something that differentiates them from one another.
        </p>

        <p>Shadowflames are intelligent creatures, first learning the basic ways by mimicking others' forms and actions.
            After a while, once they have learned everything needed for survival, they start learning by themselves,
            exploring their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>

        <p>Shadowflames, while capable of entering water, can't stay under for long periods of time without proper
            equipment as their flames are likely to die out.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Abilities</h3>

        <p>From birth, Shadowflames are able to manipulate their own flames as well as mimic other forms, completely
            inheriting their strengths, flaws, and abilities. While these abilities are on the most basic of levels,
            they
            can still be used for quite a variety of things like self-defense and basic offense.
        </p>

        <p>As they start exploring their abilities more, they'll realize that these abilities can be used for many other
            things like transportation, assistance, slow healing, or boosting movement.
        </p>

        <p>Their real strength lies in their ridiculous creativity, capable of solving most problems with their own
            creations.
        </p>

        <p>The color and intensity of a Shadowflame's aura can often shift temporarily depending on the abilities it
            uses. For example, most healing abilities will tint their flames a light green, while many offensive
            abilities will shift the color to shades ranging from red to orange.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Origins</h3>

        <p>Shadowflames originate from a planet called Pyronyx Prime. It's the closest planet to a purple star, giving
            it a natural purple atmosphere with next to no clouds.</p>

        <p>The planet itself is quite dangerous for any other species despite its beautiful and exotic surface, having
            many unique species of flora and fauna.</p>

        <p>The main reason this isn't particularly dangerous to the Shadowflame species is the location of their birth.
        </p>

        <p>Nearly all Shadowflames were born in the Pyronyx Prime's core, only being spit out when the chain eruption
            happened on the surface upon the core's awakening. This very awakening is also the reason
            that the planet's surface is habitable, despite the dangers.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Anatomy</h3>

        <p>Shadowflames are similar to humans in terms of anatomy. They have everything a human has: a flaming heart and
            a
            digestive tract; they even have the means of reproduction humans do. The only difference is their lack of
            proper lungs. Despite this, they can breathe just like any normal human can. Instead of lungs, they have a
            separate chamber-like organ that can keep air within for an extended period of time. This chamber is what's
            used to re-ignite the flames of an extinguished Shadowflame.</p>

        <p>Another key difference in their organic structure is the flaming rings around their heart, functioning as a
            source of their abilities. However, destroying these rings by any means will not hand you an advantage as
            they have adapted to physical combat as much as magical combat.</p>

        <p>Exterior anatomy shows that they appear to have no visible mouths. However, even though it's not visible,
            it's still very much there. The main reason for their mouths not being visible is their burning skin, where
            flames connect the lips together, making it look like they have no mouth.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Dietary Habits</h3>

        <p>While Shadowflames possess a digestive tract, they derive very little nutrition from organic plant or animal
            matter. They can survive without eating for years, though they do enjoy consuming proper meals occasionally.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Social Structure</h3>

        <p>Similar to humans, Shadowflames are somewhat social creatures by nature. While they possess a higher
            tolerance
            for solitude and can remain isolated for decades at a time, their social lives bear many similarities to
            humanity. They organize events, host parties, and attend schools; they even possess romantic and
            marital structures similar to those of humans.</p>

        <p>Another key aspect of their social life is that they have no defined "Leader" on their home planet.
            All Shadowflames are permitted to do as they wish, provided their actions do not disturb others. Their
            primary
            methods for resolving conflict are often cross-family bonding or civil discussion. Unlike humans, however,
            they
            generally maintain their composure and avoid starting wars over meaningless territorial disputes.</p>
