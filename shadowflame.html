            Description
        </h3>

        <p>
            Shadowflame Elementals are humanoid creatures constantly covered in what we call "Shadow flames". They are
            constantly on fire, capable of burning even without any source of fuel or oxygen.
        </p>

        <p>Apart from eternally being on fire, most of them make themselves some sort of armor at a young age to
            differentiate each other. Each member of the species has a different eye color, and they mostly make armor
            matching of said color. Each Shadowflame has a different colored eye, but on the offchance that there are
            two extremely similar ones, they have a rule to wear something that differentiates them from one another.
        </p>

        <p>Shadowflames are intelligent creatures, first learning the basic ways by mimicing others' forms and actions.
            After a while, once they have learned everything needed for survival, they start learning by themselves,
            exploring their abilities, strengths and weaknesses.</p>

        <p>Shadowflames, while capable of entering water, can't stay under for long periods of time without proper
            equipment as their flames are likely to die out.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Abilities</h3>

        <p>From birth, Shadowflames are able to manipulate their own flames as well as mimic other forms, completely
            inheriting their strengths, flaws and abilities. While these abilities are on the most basic of levels, they
            can still be used for quite a variety of things like self-defense and basic offense.
        </p>

        <p>As they start exploring their abilities more, they'll realize that these abilities can be used for many other
            things like transportation, assistance, slow healing or boosting movement.
        </p>

        <p>Their real strength lies in their ridiculous creativity, capable of solving most problems with their own
            creations.
        </p>
