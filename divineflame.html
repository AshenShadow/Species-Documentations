            Description
        </h3>

        <p>
            Divineflame Elementals are humanoid creatures whose distinct features—such as hair, hands, and legs—burn
            with what are known as "Divine Flames". These flames are capable of burning eternally without any source of
            fuel.
            As long as the Divineflame Elemental is alive, these flames will never extinguish.
        </p>

        <p>Divineflame Elementals can easily be differentiated from one another by their hairstyles,
            the intensity of their flames, and most obviously, their clothing.
        </p>

        <p>Divineflames are intelligent creatures, possessing a life cycle similar to that of humans.
            They appear small at birth but grow at a faster rate than humans.</p>

        <p>Divineflames are fully resistant to natural liquids, including water. However, their preferred environment
            is pure molten rock: lava.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Abilities</h3>

        <p>Divineflames can take up to 35 years to become accustomed to their abilities. They possess healing
            powers superior to most other species, though their offensive capabilities are rather weak by comparison.
            However, their main
            strength comes from their charm and creativity, as they are capable of conceptualizing many solutions
            despite lacking the
            mastery to fully manifest them.
        </p>

        <p>The color and intensity of a Divineflame's aura can often shift temporarily depending on the abilities being
            used. For example, most healing abilities will tint their flames a lighter green, while offensive
            abilities will shift the color to shades ranging from red to orange.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Origins</h3>

        <p>Divineflames originate from a planet called DVF-45CSP, later dubbed as Luminos-Major. This planet
            resides in an
            unstable blue star system, but is now uninhabitable due to a cataclysmic event that shattered part of the
            planet's
            crust into its orbit.</p>

        <p>Divineflames originated from the system's star, having been ejected rapidly toward the planet during a solar
            flare.
            Following this event, the species populated the planet until its inevitable destruction.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Anatomy</h3>

        <p>Divineflames are similar to humans in terms of anatomy. They possess almost everything a human does: a
            flaming heart, a
            digestive tract, and even the same means of reproduction. The primary difference lies in their lungs,
            which are capable of functioning efficiently even when inhaling toxic substances or in the absence of
            breathable air.</p>

        <p>Another key difference in their organic structure is the set of flaming rings surrounding their heart, which
            function as the
            source of their abilities. Destroying these rings provides a significant advantage against them, as it
            significantly impairs their healing efficiency.</p>

        <p>Exterior anatomy shows that they appear to have no visible mouths. However, even though it is not visible,
            the mouth is present. The main reason for this concealment is their lightly burning skin, where
            flames bridge the lips together, creating the illusion of a featureless face.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Dietary Habits</h3>

        <p>While Divineflames possess a digestive tract, they derive very little nutrition from organic plant or animal
            matter. They can survive without eating for years, though they do occasionally enjoy consuming proper meals.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Social Structure</h3>

        <p>Unlike humans, Divineflames are somewhat reclusive creatures by nature. Despite this, socialization is by no
            means a weakness.</p>

        <p>A key aspect of their social life was the lack of a defined "Leader" on their home planet.
            All Divineflames were permitted to do as they wished, provided their actions did not disturb others. Their
            primary methods for resolving conflict were often cross-family bonding or civil discussion. They generally
            maintained their composure and avoided starting wars over meaningless territorial disputes.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, this structure is rarely seen today; since the destruction of Luminos-Major, it is
            unknown how many Divineflame Elementals remain scattered across space.</p>
