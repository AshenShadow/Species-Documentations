            Description
        </h3>

        <p>
            Chaos Elementals are humanoid creatures whose skin never stays still, constantly changing and shifting.
            Despite
            this volatility, they maintain a very stationary silhouette, making them recognizable as humanoids. Their
            skin is composed of
            a dust-like substance which completely dissipates upon leaving their immediate area.
        </p>

        <p>Chaos Elementals can easily be differentiated from one another by the material of their skin and their
            individual forms.
            While their eye color may also vary between individuals, this is a highly unlikely occurrence.
        </p>

        <p>Chaos Elementals are intelligent creatures, possessing a life cycle similar to that of humans.
            They appear small at birth but grow at a faster rate than humans.</p>

        <p>Chaos Elementals are fully resistant to natural liquids, including water. However, their preferred
            environment is deep caves or highly dusty areas.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Abilities</h3>

        <p>Chaos Elementals become accustomed to their abilities almost immediately after birth. They possess powers
            capable of space manipulation, teleportation, and mind control. Their main strength lies in their ability to
            influence minds and create illusions.
        </p>

        <p>While it is impossible to physically observe which specific ability a Chaos Elemental is preparing, it
            often becomes obvious, as powerful abilities take longer to execute.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Origins</h3>

        <p>Chaos Elementals do not originate from a specific planet but can be found anywhere in the universe. They are
            born from the dust of deep caverns, which is then mixed with several different materials found within the
            cave,
            such as dust from ores, gems, or regular stone.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Anatomy</h3>

        <p>Chaos Elementals differ from humans in terms of anatomy, as they possess only a core. This core
            functions as their heart.</p>

        <p>Their only biological similarity to humans is the possession of human-like reproductive organs.</p>

        <p>Chaos Elementals do not possess a nose or mouth. However, despite the lack of a nose, they can
            still smell, and despite the lack of a mouth, they can speak. No one knows exactly how these features work,
            but it is
            widely assumed that they speak by manipulating sound waves around them.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Dietary Habits</h3>

        <p> // UNKNOWN DATA //
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="textHead">Social Structure</h3>

        <p>Chaos Elementals, while often starting out solitary or within small groups, are extremely social creatures.
            They have a deep
            understanding of others' problems and can provide excellent mental support if one manages to befriend them.
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Chaos Elementals often appear hostile at first toward other races. Despite this, they mainly
            observe and stare; unless provoked, you will not have to face one in battle.</p>
